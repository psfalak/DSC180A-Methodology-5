**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic for me was an [article](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-new-york-city-is-cracking-down-on-ai-in-hiring/).  In the article, it talked about how New York was mandating annual bias audits for AI-driven hiring tools. The main purpose of this was to mitigate any potential biases that arise from automated employment decision-making. This was interesting for me because not only do I live in New York, but they are the only state right now that does this. I'd be curious to see what other states plan to adopt this in the future.
